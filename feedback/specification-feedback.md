Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 04752a6df63b9900e3b0a7005bf16189ab4663db

### The product backlog (10/10)
•	A spreadsheet-like format is easier to read for backlogs, rather than prose or bulleted lists.  You could also explore existing online tools for generating and tracking work on a project.
•	For features as the frontend is often related to the backend it may not always be efficient to split by frontend and backend. Also work should be more evenly distributed so that all students get a chance to show multiple skills 
•	Next time provide a cost estimate for each feature, in hours.  If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours, consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve their ability to track progress on it.

### Data models (7/10)
•	We were expecting a more formal specification of the models, it didn’t have to be code however if not code should have been something like uml to more rigorously show the relationship between models. 
•	It is unclear why you would create a model for word and keyword. Seems to be unnecessary when you should just search the file. 

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)
•	One of the key features in your project that you describe is being able to navigate between files and find files where functions are defined. Neither your models or your wireframes demonstrate an idea of how you plan on doing this.
